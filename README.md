# Where's Waldo?

![Alt text](./img/Screenshot.png)

This project is a simple web app of a [Where's Waldo?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F) game. It only has one game to play with, and is not very hard, but it is a learning project after all. It uses Node Express on the back-end and React on the front-end.

To beat the game, you must find 4 characters, which is done by clicking the character on the image and then clicking its image on the dropdown selector box that will appear. While the game is running, there will also be a timer running at the top of the page, and after finding all four characters, you can choose to submit your time on the leaderboard, which can be checked out on the starting page as well.

While starting this project, I first developed the front-end, finding a suitable image and creating the CSS for the page. Then I moved on to the back-end, which responsible for responding in case the user clicked a character properly or not. To finish it all off, I developed the leaderboard, which was simple enough.

This is yet another project of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) NodeJS course.
